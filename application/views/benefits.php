                    <p class="mb-1-9 mt-n2 text-justify">
                        The innovative design of Arcas' micro movable biochar manufacturing units ensures that they can be easily transported directly to the farms. This eliminates the need for farmers to transport their agricultural waste to a central processing facility, significantly reducing transportation costs. By converting farm waste on-site into valuable biochar, farmers can produce carbon without the added expense and hassle of long-distance transport. </p>

                            The pyrolysis process used in our biochar units captures carbon from stores it in a stable form within the biochar. This prevents the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, effectively sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
