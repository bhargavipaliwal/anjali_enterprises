                            <p>Arcas offers its solar-powered micro movable biochar manufacturing units to farmers through Self-Help Groups (SHG) and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO). This collaborative approach ensures that the technology is accessible to a wide range of farmers, particularly smallholders who might not have the resources to invest in such equipment individually.

                                    Farmers can enter into service agreements with their respective SHG or FPO, detailing the terms of use, scheduling, and maintenance of the biochar units.

                                    This model fosters community collaboration, where farmers can schedule the use of the biochar units according to their needs, ensuring equitable access and efficient utilization.
